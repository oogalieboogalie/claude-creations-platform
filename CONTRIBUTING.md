## 📝 **Code Style**

### **General Principles**
- **Clarity over cleverness** - code should be easy to understand
- **Minimal cognitive load** - reduce complexity where possible
- **Accessibility first** - consider neurodivergent developers
- **Progressive enhancement** - work without JavaScript

### **JavaScript**
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

### **CSS**
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use semantic class names
- Prefer flexbox and grid
- Maintain accessibility (contrast, focus states)

### **API Design**
- RESTful endpoints
- Consistent error responses
- Clear documentation
- Rate limiting considerations

## 🧪 **Testing**

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Test CLI tool
node cli-submit.js help
node cli-submit.js detect
```

## 📚 **Documentation**

- Update README.md for new features
- Add API documentation for new endpoints
- Include examples in code comments
- Consider CLI help text

## 🎨 **Design Principles**

### **For Neurodivergent Developers**
- **Minimal friction** - reduce steps to accomplish tasks
- **Clear feedback** - obvious success/error states
- **Predictable UX** - consistent patterns throughout
- **Escape hatches** - always provide manual alternatives to automation

### **For the Community**
- **Inclusive language** - welcoming to all skill levels
- **Open source spirit** - encourage sharing and remixing
- **Performance matters** - fast loading, responsive design
- **Privacy conscious** - minimal data collection

## 🔐 **Security**

- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow OWASP guidelines
- Report security issues privately

## 🏷️ **Commit Messages**
