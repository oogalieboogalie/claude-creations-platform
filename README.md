# 🖋️ Censai Says Weblog

**Personal blog platform for highly opinionated solopreneur thoughts**

A modern web platform where Censai shares unfiltered thoughts on entrepreneurship, technology, and life as biodegradable material wandering through the digital landscape.

> **Repurposed from a community platform** - Sometimes the best pivot is admitting your original idea was a complete flop and turning it into something actually useful.

## 🎯 **The Story**

This used to be a community showcase platform for Claude Code developers. It had beautiful code, clean architecture, responsive design - and exactly zero organic users. So we did what any sensible solopreneur would do: pivoted faster than you can say "product-market fit doesn't exist."

## 💡 **What It Is Now**

A personal blog where highly opinionated takes meet clean code. No community features, no voting systems, no user accounts - just pure, unfiltered thoughts from someone wandering through the startup ecosystem.
